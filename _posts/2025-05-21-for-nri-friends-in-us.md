US is in crisis, NRIs your wealth in US is about to wiped out.

Purpose of putting this. It's very hard to relate all the things and get a clear picture with the short spans of our attentions that we pay in our whatsapp chats.  

Why I am writing all this is so that my NRI friends can plan and save their earned wealth over last 2 decades. In view of the upcoming geopolitical and geo economical changes.

It's already late, but they are not able to see the upcomming storm even now.

Now let's start...  
I will use tweets as the data, so they are time-stamped well.

July 14th 2024  
In this it is clearly stated what Trump will do as US president. Before the elections.
> Trump will De-globalise saying i want to save & build back US, so i am de-coupling with Asia, don't want illegal or unskilled immigrants, will lay tariffs on exports to US... 

If you see exactly these are the things Trump has done in the last 4-5 months.

Let's go one by one, and see which happened?

First point.
> Trump is going to operate the economy before the crisis comes & give the medicine.

April 4th 2025

Second point. Is anyway happening.  
> Elon musk will ensure that a huge chunk of Govt expenditure is wrapped up. The federal Govt. which is the largest employer in the US will be laying off people.

Trird point.

Also, the country wont be livable few years from now for rich NRIs.
