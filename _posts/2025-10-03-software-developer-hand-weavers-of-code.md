Notes: 
I don't believe in projections first [11:58]
You cannot predict, timelines.
Most important things cannot be done in time.
Ideas don't come on a schedule.

Rule of thumb:
If the CEO is a pure MBA, I know it's a good company to compete with, because I think we can destroy them in the market.

Competing with smart technical people, will raise our game.

Salesforce is bullshit to the core.

Executive rooms: good way to screw yourself.

You have only 5-10 people.
Have you put yourself in a position they will tell you the truth.

Life sets you many traps.
Prestige is a trap.
Life supplies you lot of free traps. free prisons.
Decision making, leadership, even more traps.
Most failures comes from these traps.

Freeing the mind. 
When travel by train, you meet and get information.

always consider the context of the nation in everything we do.
1.4 Billion people, 
23 million babies per year.
china has only 9 million babies per year.
Numbers law many people don't relaize.

there are no easy solutions for what we have. But solutions start here.

how to create employment
how to create talent pool
how to create skills, problem-solving skills

3 million is bigger than most american cities. // coimbothore. then why do you say it is tier-2 city?
80,000 people, tenkasi is bigger than california, new jersy
our population density is so high.

we don't have tallent is bullshit, we have it.
we just have to find it, we have the number of kids born, we have number of raw talent.
we have to find it, that's our duty.

there are no villages in India, everything is a town. Can we make it pleasant?
pond, park, small things
Our job is to live well, wealth creation is a bullshit. Financial stock market is a wealth, it's not.
The real wealth is do we have nice trains everywhere?
do we have parks?
do our people have decent quality of life?
that is wealth, keep that in mind.

The poeple who will come and stay in Tenkasi, will be our employees.

You have to be stubbon, you stand your ground.

The routine stuff dominates programming. Boiler plate.
Automate 

We are hand weavers of code.
Software is digital cott age industry.

What we are doing sounds high-tech, but what we are doing is painstaking.
Software was a handloom bussiness, until now. Now, powerful machine looms are coming, the equivalent of air jet, water jet, all that is coming now, looms. Robotic looms, that is coming.

we should consider ourselves as weavers, hand loom weavers, we should think about what we are going to do and that's a big problem. Big problem if you are a software company.

We don't have birthright to get a high-paying job as a software engineer or retain a high-paying job as a software engineer. Nobody has a birthright.
Why don't weavers have a birthright?
Why don't farmers have a birthright?
School teachers don't have a birthright?
Nurses, Police Constables
Nobody has a birthright
how the technologies evolves, that how we are.

the truth is, today in software, this wave is coming steadily, a lot of AI is overhyped but sill, i see sufficient potential in productivity gains. In fact, I myself am experiencing some of it. Software consumption have to go up a lot, or prices will have to crash.

Soil feed us, AI cannot feed us.
Soil expert, cow expert, water expert, might be payed 2L per month.
sustainability might be a big big bussiness.
Those are the people who distribute, so people can buy cheap iPhone and zero SaaS software.
1 liter of milk and zoho subscription.

Typically financial capital and patience don't mix.

People don't want to be on a threadmill, but financial capital wants that threadmill.
