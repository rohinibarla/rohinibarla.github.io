**I was amazed at how little of the life around me was illuminated by this education.** In time, I also realised that the reason I had read literature produced in and about another society was because the university system did not consider literature produced in India to be the real thing.

The cornerstone of Devy’s work has been an examination of the links between knowledge and power, and the monopoly on knowledge by the elite throughout the course of human history. He wrote in the essay “The Being of Bhasha”: “The Barbarians do not have knowledge, the Romans have it. Those who speak or recite Sanskrit have knowledge; those who speak Prakrit have no knowledge. Those who speak English have knowledge, those who do not have no knowledge worth the name. Such is the political context of every knowledge system.”

All the economically and scientifically developed countries like France, Germany, China, and Japan take pride in their own languages and prefer English just as a second language, he said.

“India was colonised for long time period during which Indian culture was de-emphasised. Now it’s time to de-colonise and change the colonial mind set as China and Japan have done,” said Bhargava stressing that India needs to free herself from such mindset to become a global leader — scientifically, economically and culturally.



“India is one of the few countries trying to give preference to a foreign language (English). It should be a secondary language and all the subjects should be taught in Hindi, Sanskrit or in other Indian languages,” he suggested.

Bhargava claims that a large number of computer scientists and mathematicians in the world study Sanskrit for better understanding of subjects but the language is ignored in its native country.

Bhargava, who was afraid of Mathematics classes, started loving numbers after reading Sanskrit books of his grandfather Purushottam Lal Bhargava who taught the language at University of Rajasthan.

“Learning mathematics will become fun and interest in Sanskrit too will increase through the new curriculum which will have creative elements. In fact, all Indian languages must be given importance so that they can be connected with employment,” said Bhargava who teaches a course ‘Magic of Numbers’ built by combining Sanskrit and mathematics at Princeton University.
