saṃgacchadhwaṃ saṃvadadhwaṃ  
saṃ vo manāṃsi jānatām  
devā bhāgaṃ yathā pūrve  
sañjānānā upāsate |   - Rig Veda  
    
   
May you move in equanimity, speak in equanimity;   
May your minds know equanimity;   
Just as the ancient ones approached Gods through their offerings, established in equanimity!  
  
These children truly are living embodiments of equanimity! It would truly be a privilege learning from them! 🙏🙏🙏
