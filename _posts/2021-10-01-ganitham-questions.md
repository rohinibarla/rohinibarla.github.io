There is sample question like.

For people with Telugu as mother tongue.

Q: Given a circle how do you find it's center.
[Read the question in Telugu]. vaka circle isthey dhani center ela kanukuntaaru?
[For Telugu medium] The question will be written in Telugu like 
Vaka vrutham isthey dhani kendra bindhuvu ela kanukuntaru?

It will read in telugu as well. 

So a question with diagram, text, reading it in complete telugu and semi-telugu.
