## Indian rope geometry

Now, India has had an old tradition of geometry from the days of the śulba sūtra-s (−6th c. CE), which precede Greek geometry. The “śulba” refers to a rope, and “rajju”, also meaning rope, or string, was a common part of the Indian school syllabus in pre-British times. It is still used by artisans, but is no longer taught in formal schools—such practical things are looked down upon from the (“Platonic”) point of view of geometry regarded as high metaphysical discourse.

The introduction of British education in India, even in contexts where there was no noticeable colonial plot, sometimes made local people conceptually and technologically dependent on remote foreign sources, while teaching techniques that were inferior to local techniques. Let us see this in the case of the rope vs the compass-box.

The rope can be used to do a number of things.

1. By holding it taut one can draw a straight line, so it can perform the function of a straight edge.
2. By choosing any appropriate unit, it can be made into a scale (as in a measuring tape). Traditionally, knots were used for marks. This “primitive” technique, when combined with the two-scale principle (nowadays called the Vernier principle) as in early navigational instruments like the kamāl, gives a remarkably high degree of accuracy. (In particular, the kamāl I obtained from the Lakshadweep islands, though ridiculed as “primitive” by 19th c. British historians, could measure angles accurate to 10' of the arc or 1/6 degree. British school education replaced it by a steel sextant, and the sextant the islanders could afford was less accurate being graduated in degrees.)
3. By keeping one end fastened and moving the other end around, one can draw a circle. So the rope performs the func- tion of a compass.
4. Most importantly, a rope can be used to directly measure the length of the arc, hence an angle in radians: simply lay the rope along the curve, and straighten it to compare with the length of a straight line segment _(A measuring tape could be laid “edge-on” along the curve)_. Because it can be used to measure circular arcs, a rope also serves as a protractor which measures angles in radians.
5. By marking two points on it, a distance can be picked and carried, so a rope (or string) can perform the function of a divider.
6. Using the “fish figure” (the figure in Elements 1.1), it is easy to construct a right angle, and by bisecting or trisecting it, it is easy to construct angles of 45◦ , 30◦ , and 60◦ , so a rope is also a substitute for set squares.
7. By fastening two points, one can also draw an ellipse with the rope. This is impossible with the compass-box.

So, a rope (or a piece of twine) can be used to do everything that can be done with a compass-box, and something more: it can measure the length of both straight and curved lines. The most important new capability is the fourth one, above, for it directly assigns a meaning to the length of the arc, or the length of a curved line. This is the sort of meaning that a child can easily grasp (with the hand as well as the mind). The same thing is not possible with a ruler, and assigning a meaning to a curved line starting from straight lines requires the calculus.
