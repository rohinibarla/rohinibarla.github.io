> What about students coming from English medium schools and what is the fate of those schools? Fate of English faculty or teachers. 

If we look around   
1. All the most well-to-do countries teach their children in Mother Tongue.
2. Most of these countries are smaller in size than our states in Bharat. For sure in terms of population and majority of them in size of land as well. Some countries' sizes are even in the range of our districts.
3. Since we(Govt.) decided to move in this direction to teach in Bharathiya Languages. We need to start the transition of the systems and people to this new direction.
4. All these steps are pragmatic ways of doing.
  
Please check the Twitter of Mamidala Jagadesh Kumar, Chairman, UGC. https://twitter.com/mamidala90  
To see this transition.  

e.g: for the word mic, we can use the word **Shabdha-Grahakam** which captures sound. Similarly, for the word camera, it's **Chitra-Grahakam**.   
And these words can be well understood in every Bharathiya language.  
  
Samskrutham language contains words describing only the properties of an object.  
  
There is one beautiful thing in Bharat.  
1. Samskrutham is not an object-specific language.
2. And all the Bharatheya languages are related and use many of the words from Samskrutham.
  
This gives us a simple and effective way to translate technical terms to Bharatheya languages.

The steps we are seeing are all initial step of the movement.  
  
But we are moving towards this goal...  
  
The Panchakosha education system.  
+ Physical Development
+ Development of Life Energy
+ Emotional/Mental Development 
+ Intellectual Development
+ Spiritual Development
  
The National Curriculum Framework (NCF) in Bharat has integrated these concepts into the NEP.
