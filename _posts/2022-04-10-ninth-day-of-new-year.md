Vinayaka Chavithi - Vinayaka Chavithi is 4th(Chavithi) day of that month.    
Vijaya Dhasami - Vijaya Dasami is the 10th(Dasami) day of that month.  

Vyakunta Ekaadhasi - Vyakunta Ekaadhasi means 11th(Eka + dhasimi) day of that month.

Next time when you see any festival description, identify if there is any date in it. Slowly you will understand the scientificness of the Bharat calender.  

At the time of independence, we must have decided to follow Bharath Calender. But unfortunately, it was a transfer of power but not independence in reality. So the colonization continued. Now time is ripe and people have come to know, what is truth and what is a lie. What is scientific and what is not scientific. 

Hope you also get this clarity the earliest, if not yet.
