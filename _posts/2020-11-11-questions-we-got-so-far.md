**In short:**  
Gateway to R&D Online | first step - Nov 16th, 2020 | 3 months | Weekly 3 days evening classes (6:45-8pm) | Practice like a professional to become top R&D engineer | No prior programming experience is required

## Do you provide certificates?

Yes, you will be awarded a certificate upon completing each course. There are two courses, Gateway to R&D and Gateway to R&D Advanced.

## Complete course duration?

It is for 3 months. Since we have Sankranthi in the coming 3 months. The duration will be extended for 10 more days.

## Any chances to conduct classes offline?

No - We have students from multiple cities.

## Who are eligible for this course?

You need to have a laptop or desktop with a webcam and a stable internet.
You need to spend a minimum of 2-3 hours daily on this course. The more time you spend, the more value you get out of this process.

Anyone who has an interest in learning to code and to create software can join.
Whatever may be the reason, either getting a good job or anything might be the reason you are interested you could join.

## Do we have to learn python programming before joining this course?

No. We will train you from scratch. No prior programming experience is required. Python is the medium we use to learn problem-solving. The goal is to become capable of developing software in any new programming language by learning it in 2 weeks. When we have this capability, we are assured of our career. We can bring our ideas into reality by creating software solutions.

## Does this course provides an internship?

Yes, when you complete Gateway to R&D and Gateway to R&D Advanced programs, we will provide you internships in software companies.

## Is this course helpful for getting our dream companies (e.g., AMAZON) like product-based. (FAANG)?

If you are in 1st year or 2nd year of B.Tech, then yes, you will get in FAANG companies. After completing the Gateway to R&D Advanced course. You will become an independent problem-solver. As you keep practicing and experimenting and exploring different software frameworks and technologies. You will become capable and will be selected in product companies.

## While doing this course, is there any chance to build our mini projects?

As part of Gateway to R&D for beginners, we will do simple projects. But as part of the Gateway to R&D Advanced course, we will do decent sized projects. So as part of the Advanced course, you will surely build mini-projects.

## Is there any demo class?

We run the program in a practical mode. It's learning by doing. We believe that's the only way to learn software development.

Theory classes will be minimal. Class hours are mostly spent on exploring the topics where students have doubts.

So demo classes do not fit into our model. If you want, I can share with you the recording of classes once we start the classes.

## What if I realize, after joining that this course does not work for me?

No need to worry about does this course work for me or not. You will never lose money in the process.

You register for the course by paying 5K. When you realize within 2 weeks after starting that this course is not working for you.

Without asking a question, I will refund the 5K when you say, "it's not working for me."

I will take money only when I can provide value to you.

## Will you teach Python programming language?

Yes, we will teach you how to code in Python from scratch. The goal is not to teach Python but to make you capable of learning any programming language in 2 weeks and creating software using the new language.

We use Python language as the medium to make you understand the fundamental concepts of software development, which are common across different programming languages. Once you understand these core concepts by solving various problems, learning a new language will be like a piece of cake.

Just see which state is better?  
I know C, Java and Python languages. Or  
**I know Python in-depth and can pick up any language in a few weeks.**
