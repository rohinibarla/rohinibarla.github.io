Some key notes

---

We have to gather courage and realise that it is truly liberating to end the relationships with Shadows. It is truly liberating to **present ourselves in relationships** and not present our shadows instead.  

It is also important to recognise that Shadow remains and has its place in the scheme of things in reality. Its presence is like the force of nature. Prakriti that keeps pushing us to manifest our authentic self. Without this presence, humans will not grow. So, the stigma around it is also detrimental. **Denial of shadow is also detrimental**.  

Humans need shadows until such a time as they **learn to simply exist, simply be**, like a tree or a mountain.

While reading the article written by [Shri Ramachandra Roddam Garu](https://substack.com/@fragranceofshakti), I felt I heard **"Buddhi rupena samsthitha"** in [Sound of Isha](https://www.youtube.com/@soundsofisha)

When I searched I found a video, which is reprised yesterday, it's 7 years old and new one is reprised yesterday. Here is the link.
