Here are two resources to learn Python.   

These are interactive books where you will read, edit, and run programs from within the pages of these ebooks inside the browser. The best thing about these books is that they use Python to explain computer science fundamentals and big ideas in computer science.  


First one is [CS Principles: Big Ideas in Programming](https://www.openbookproject.net/books/StudentCSP/).  

Second one is [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/thinkcspy/index.html).  

For video tutorials, [Socratica - Python Programming Tutorials](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLi01XoE8jYohWFPpC17Z-wWhPOSuh8Er-) is the best one.
