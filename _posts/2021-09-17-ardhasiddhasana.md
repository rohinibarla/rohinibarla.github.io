Why do many gods sculptures and photos are depicted with them sitting in a specific style. Their left leg folded and right leg hanging down?

[ add an image of lakshmi devi, someone in ardhasiddhasana]

There are two things I want to bring your attention to in this article.
One is the inner science of Ardhasiddhasana. Second is to make you think around what time did they discovered this.

[video of sadhguru explaining this]

Sitting in a way that the left heal touches the mooladhara. This will stop the nature calling process for a duration. It will stabilize a lot of thing in the body.

Majority of the educated bunch, find it difficult to accept there is a science and technology for wellbeing and Chakaras or Energy meeting points. That there is an Energy body, along with out physical body. 

I am not saying to blindly accept it. But should we not try to explore about the truth than just looking it with suspicion. The majority of the educated folks in Bharat look suspicious about these inner science that we have in this land. This is what education is doing, disconnecting from our roots, for majority of the population. This great inner science and their workings, which the current hi-tech instruments of science cannot detect, has been observed and experimented with and found out the best ways to harness and enhance our perception using these intrecate details. These are documented - I am not sure but have surely passed on over generations. Documenting it may mess up with the finest of the details, so avoided documentation, but passed in entirely different ways which a thinking mind cannot understand, but can be experienced. By seeing lot of people who have been transmitted this knowledge in a way we cannot imagine. There is higher bandwidh of transmission mechanism, which is yet to me made into a utility for the use of computing pusposes.


> Doubt is good. It means you are searching for truth. Suspicion is sickness â€“ it means you already made a negative conclusion.


Finally, why am refering to the images of gods sitting in this poster is, one thing is clear, this has been discovered very very long back. They were able to understand that if you can make two points in your body touch, will slow the physical acitivity that is happening inside the body. How did they discover? How was this knowledge transmitted? Was it transfered by Adhiyogi/Adhiguru? They say that he is swayambhoo? Did he walk the land of Bharat as it is described in many stories we hear? If Adhiyogi has walked upon this land, what about Rama and Krishna, did they also walked upon this land? These are questions. But one thing is clear, that Agasthya muni, Aadhi Sankaracharya have walked upon this land, who has brought us this inner science. I do Shastanga namaskaram to all these guru's who have transmitted these and making people experience the things discoved in that early period on this land and still continueing. 

There is an expiry date for everything. I am because my parents have made me study and go through something. We cannot keep on saying it play victim card game. Similarly I am like this because the education system I have gone through has made me to be a doubting Thomos, and feel like I a scientific mind by studing few concepts from few books that too to pass an exam. We cannot keep playing the victic card game. There is expiry date for this. So take some time, energy, effort to connect back to our roots. Once we connect back to our roots, no one can stop us from succeeding in what ever endeaver we set our eyes upon. Either it be external success or inner success.

Hope you get a change to experience yourself the ardhasiddhasana. Namaskharam.
