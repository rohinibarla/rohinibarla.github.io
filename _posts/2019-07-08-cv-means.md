# ‘योगश्चित्तवृत्तिनिरोधः’

When I saw the above line in the [book by Dr. BM Hegde](https://www.amazon.in/What-Doctors-Study-Medical-School/dp/8181914198). I was surprised by the meaning of it and his reference to Patanjali’s writings. Hegde is Cardiologists and suggests that Allopathic practitioners must look into the wealth of knowledge in Ayurveda, to become a better healer.
…

The [Patanjali Sthotram](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWlDK86stIc) was played in the car for over 4+ years with other music. As we are traveling one day recently, my daughter said ‘idhi naa paata’ (this is my song), and kept the volume to MAX in the car. She was sitting in the back and just listening. I reduced the sound, she reached the volume control and set it back to MAX. So I can’t sing this song, only she can sing it. I can sing any other song.

Then came an international yoga day. A [new musical rendition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVojRjzUJLE) was released for Pathanjali Yoga Sutras. It was the same lyrics, but with a different style of singing and ….

… and now yoga.

The meaning of the lyrics was given in description and this line struck me…

> शब्दज्ञानानुपाती वस्तुशून्यो विकल्पः  
> Conceptualization derives from linguistic knowledge, not contact with real things

I have got all these thoughts and insights from linguistic knowledge only. This act of writing this post is also in the form of linguistic knowledge.

This reminded me of Jinan K.B’s [work](https://www.jinankb.in/). He has clearly [articulated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qktsT4ngko) that the moment we make our children sit in the classroom of a school. We disconnect them from nature and put them in the four walls. Disconnect from the experience mode and make them learn words, and make them experience everything through words and texts. Instead of using the language for expressing their experiences through their senses, we make the experience and sense the world through words. We make them word-literates instead of sense-literates. There is no first-hand knowledge. Everything we consume is second-hand knowledge. We process it and reason about it and produce some second-hand information. I recommend you to see his research [articles](https://independent.academia.edu/JinanKodapully).

A few days later met a great human being. He is Dr. Ravi Shankar Pollisetty. He is a Cardiologist practicing Ayurveda. He worked for long years to show to the world that Ayurvedha is scientific. His vision has inspired me. When he explained about core concepts of Ayurvedha, he referred Chitta Vrutthi in a formula as a CV.

CV + … = VPK + …

My abbreviation of CV changed to Chitta Vruthi from the common one.

Dr. Ravi Shankar’s [work overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCEKXrZYGDI) and his [fundamental first breakthrough](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254972554_Effect_of_various_diets_prescribed_in_The_Indian_System_of_Medicine_on_the_resting_potential_of_cells). After interacting with him got interested in Sanskrit. When searched on YouTube, [‘The Sanskrit Channel’](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqFg6QnwgtVHo1iFgpxrx-A) by Uday Shreyas popped up. In one of the videos, he explained the [scientificness of Sanskrit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fI7Qy1NbrI), which led to great insight into the order of alphabets in the Telugu language.

Muladhara, Swadhistana, Manipuraka, Anahatha, Vishudhi, Agna, Sahasrar.

My daughter can repeat these names of [chakras](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW0bRpdPnUE) along with me. When you are interested, it takes very little time to byheart, is what my experience showed me.

Yesterday while about to sleep, we both were listening and singing Patanjali Sthotram multiple times in a loop.

## Lyrics and Meaning of Patanjali Sthotram:

योगश्चित्तवृत्तिनिरोधः  
Yoga is to still the patterning of consciousness  
तदा द्रष्टुः स्वरूपेऽवस्थानम्  
Then, pure awareness can abide in its very nature  
वृत्ति सारूप्यमितरत्र  
Otherwise, awareness takes itself to be the patterns of consciousness  
वृत्तयः पञ्चतय्यः क्लिष्टाक्लिष्टाः  
There are five types of patterns, including both hurtful and benign  
प्रमाण विपर्यय विकल्प निद्रा स्मृतयः  
They are right perception, misperception, conceptualization, deep sleep, and remembering  
प्रत्यक्षानुमानागमाः प्रमाणानि  
Right perception arises from direct observation, inference, or the words of others  
विपर्ययो मिथ्याज्ञानमतद्रूप प्रतिष्ठम्  
Misperception is false knowledge, not based on what actually is  
शब्दज्ञानानुपाती वस्तुशून्यो विकल्पः  
Conceptualization derives from linguistic knowledge, not contact with real things  
अभावप्रत्ययालम्बना तमोवृत्तिर्निद्र  
Deep sleep is a pattern grounded in the perception that nothing exists  
अनुभूतविषयासंप्रमोषः स्मृतिः  
Remembering is the retention of experiences  
अभ्यासवैराग्याभ्यां तन्निरोधः  
Both practice and non-reaction are required to still the patterning of consciousness
