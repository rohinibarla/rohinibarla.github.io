Dear Startup Founder,

Campus hiring is tedious, time consuming and you're never assured whether candidates will join or not. 
That said, it's the best source for young, high energy, cost-effective talent.  

I can help you! Who am I you ask?  
  
With a rich background at Microsoft, Veritas, Kony Labs, and co-founding Apxor, I've mastered the art of spotting exceptional tech talent.

**Why Choose Me?**
1. **Industry Expertise**: Years of experience in both tech giants and startups.
2. **No Upfront Fees**: Pay only when a vetted candidate joins your team.
3. **Efficient Screening**: I manage the bulk of the hiring process; you step in only for the final interview.

**Pricing**:
- Internship: Rs. 16,000/-
- Full-Time: One month's salary.

Let's join hands to bring the best talent to your startup. Reach out to discuss further.

Best,  
Rohini Kumar Barla
