There are some secret relationships that I have found. One is when I sit-still, my mind becomes calm and almost still. There is some secret relation between body movements and mind activity.

I am saying it as a secret because many people don’t know. But putting in the right words. I know experientially that there is a relationship between them but don’t know how it is established and maintained?

Similarly, the way I feel and the way I breathe. Both of these also have a relationship. 

These secret relationships can be experienced, but I don’t know how they maintain that relationship. I want to exploit these relationships and make the best use of my faculties like mind, body, emotions.
