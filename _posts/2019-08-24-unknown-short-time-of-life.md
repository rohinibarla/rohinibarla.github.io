The body I have is what I accumulated from the soil. Every day I take in many things and excrete somethings. I inhale the air used by everyone to live. The sun gives the needed energy for everything to run.

Death is inevitable. When is it also not known? Life is very limited. You have a fixed time. So don’t waste time doing things that do not improve this life. Maybe I need to write all the things I am doing daily and wanted to do in life. With this lense of the unknown short time of life, I need to strike off the things that do not matter and add those that matter.

**Let’s be joyful. Do everything with involvement.**
