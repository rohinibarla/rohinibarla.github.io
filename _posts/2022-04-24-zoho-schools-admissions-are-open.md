Do you know anyone studying MPC Inter 2nd year or +2?  
And interested in Software development or Software design. And want to take CSE branch in Engineering.  
There is a better alternative to becoming software engineer...  

Admissions to that alternative opened yesterday. Here it is... 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">ðŸ“¢ Zoho Schools Admissions Announcement ðŸ“¢ <br><br>Admissions are open now for the Schools of Technology, Business, and Design. <br><br>Apply here - Schools of Technology and Business: <a href="https://t.co/RtSJJ2bWaA">https://t.co/RtSJJ2bWaA</a>. <br><br>Apply here - School of Design: <a href="https://t.co/0LtkPwKjyv">https://t.co/0LtkPwKjyv</a><br><br>All the best! <a href="https://t.co/uWCqDy5nSn">pic.twitter.com/uWCqDy5nSn</a></p>&mdash; Zoho Schools of Learning (@ZohoSchools) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZohoSchools/status/1514848848966873090?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 15, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <br>


I strongly recommend to consider this options.  

[School of Technology](https://www.zohoschools.com/zs-technology)  
[School of Design](https://www.zohoschools.com/zs-design)  
[School of Bussiness](https://www.zohoschools.com/zs-business)  

In case you know someone who has already completed B.Tech and want to get a software job, keep looking for month of June 2022.  
More details here at [A Preparatory
Boot Camp](https://www.zohoschools.com/gradstudies).

Please let people know for whom it might be useful. And who are in the age between 20 and 24.

The other best part the student get's paid while studying. Student need not pay.
