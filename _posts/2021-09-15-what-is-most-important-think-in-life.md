That you are alive.

When mortality is with us all the time, we would live sensibly and joyfully. 
Being conscious of mortality will make us drive in the direction of every decision we take in every moment.

When you are aware of mortality, things that we carry on our head crumbles down and melt like ice. For example these a few
- What others think about me, simply others opinions.
- Anxiety of something is gone.
- The value we carry for physical things and relationships with people.

We start thinking of what really matters to us and do it.

Here is a simple activity but huge potential. Itâ€™s almost like a trivial thing to do. The only thing needed is to have sense.
