Everyone has the capacity to understand. When you explain in the language which was naturally acquired. In the mother tongue or local language.

Now let’s see the two ways Organic and Synthetic.

## Organic way:

Learns to speak in languages he is surrounded with. Interacting with people and the environment at home. Anything around him is absorbed. He decides what to do. He directs the attention and attends and reacts to everything around.

## Synthetic way:

What is there to absorb in school? Lot’s of indirections. Arbitrarily created environment. Rules created for the convenience of the administrators. Forced to be followed by children and parents. Others suggest what to do. His attention is guided by others.
