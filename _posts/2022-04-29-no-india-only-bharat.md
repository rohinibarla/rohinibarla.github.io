"    
I am really waiting for a day when there will be no India there will be only Bharat.  
    
When i studied like Vikram said we were only told  
what is wrong  
with this nation  
  
you have caste issues  
you have women empowerment issues  
you are a dirty filthy country  
you are weak people  
you didn't know how to fight   
you have no courage  
  
that's how I grew up believing  
that everybody else in this world yes we  
are spiritual we had some great people  
Ram and Krishna and  
great gods or great people  
but  
in our DNA we are weak people  
we were never a great country  
until the time.....

Check the opening comments of Vikram Sampath as well. Our great past heros and black spots of our history. Whitewashing does not help. We need to acknowledge them and move on for a better future.

"He who controls the past controls the future." - George Orawell

History is a subject which gives us the identity as the nation. As an individual.

Cultural subjugation of the mind, takes longer time to undo it.
