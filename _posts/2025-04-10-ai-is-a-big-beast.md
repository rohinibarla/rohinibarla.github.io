It's just like, if you have to plant this tree, two men would come and dig with a crowbar and shovel or whatever. They would take, two hours to dig.  

Today one machine comes and digs 500 holes and goes away.
In two hours, are we not happy?  

That you don't have to dig, you don't have to fill.  
Machines are doing all that without even you noticing it.  

So similarly, all the so-called intellectual work that you are doing, what you are doing is gathering data, building memory. And your memory is never reliable, like your phones. All right, you know mixes up, and then finding expression to analyze it and find some kind of expression.  

These things if machines do, it will be very good.  

You must lose your job if you are not doing anything significant that a human being can do.  
You are only doing mechanical job. You will lose it.  
The significance of human existence is not realized in this silly labor that we are doing.  

What do you do for a living?  
I breathe
