Krishna born on Astami (8th day of Krishna paksham) in Sravana masam. Very long long ago... still we celebrate his birthday :-) :-) :-)


In yoga, we say, "If you have one eye on the goal, you have only one eye to find your way. It is inefficient.” Devotion to the process renders you to a goal that you have not even imagined possible. This is the essence of Krishna’s teaching. -Sg #KrishnaJanmashtami
