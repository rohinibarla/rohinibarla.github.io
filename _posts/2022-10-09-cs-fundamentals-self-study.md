_You have completed B.Tech and you have time at your hand._

The best way to spend your time well is to do these activities and in the process become strong and clear about the fundamentals required for software development.

Do all the activities in the above courses: `Computer Science Fundamentals`, `Algorithm Fundamentals` and `Data Structures`. Also `Computer Memory` course. These are really the courses that you see everywhere. But a bunch of activities grouped under the name course.  

Another is to solve all the problems in `cs50.net`, I am not saying do the course and see the video. Your goal is to solve all the problems from this course. For that if needed watch the class recordings.

Similarly solve all the projects from `nand2tetris.org` course.

The important principle is **put what ever time it takes, to solve these problems on your own** without using google. Solve each problem by just using the course materials provided as part of the courses.  

If you have done all these, I can place you in many companies. You can reachout to me :-)
