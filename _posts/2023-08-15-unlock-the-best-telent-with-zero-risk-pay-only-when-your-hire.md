**Unlock the Best Talent with Zero Risk: Pay Only When You Hire!**

Dear startup founder,

In the ever-evolving tech landscape, finding the right talent is both an art and a science. With my extensive experience working with top-tier product companies like Microsoft (Windows Server OS team), Veritas, and Kony Labs, and co-founding the successful product startup, [Apxor](https://apxor.com), I've honed the skill of identifying and nurturing exceptional talent.

**Why Partner with Me?**  

1. **Deep Industry Experience**: My journey through the tech world, from established giants to innovative startups, has given me a unique perspective on what makes a developer truly stand out.

2. **Result-Based Pricing Model**: My confidence in delivering value is reflected in my pricing model. You only pay when a candidate I've vetted joins your company. No upfront fees, no hidden charges.

3. **Comprehensive Screening Process**: I handle the major parts of the campus drive - from written tests and coding rounds to preliminary interviews. Your team only steps in for the final round, ensuring you meet only the most promising candidates.

4. **Transparent Pricing**:
   - Internship Placement: Rs. 16,000/-
   - Full-Time Conversion: One month of the candidate's salary.

**The Value Proposition**:
You focus on growing your startup, while I ensure you have the best talent to help you achieve your vision. It's a partnership where you only invest when you see tangible results.

I invite you to leverage my expertise and connections to enhance your team's capabilities. Let's collaborate to build a brighter future for your startup with the right talent.

Looking forward to a fruitful partnership.
