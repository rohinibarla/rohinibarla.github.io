I want to become comfortable with software development. Where should I focus on?

The following statements are true.

The right set of _skills_, combined with solid fundamentals, makes knowledge acquisition _easier_.

Combining strong fundamentals with a software engineering skill-set _unlocks_ any topic that you might want to learn. Focus on these things _first_, and they will serve you for your entire career.

The above points are from this [article](https://medium.com/launch-school/what-people-misunderstand-about-launch-school-837f6d089048).

Chris Lee writes well on this topic and executes his ideas in Launch School.
