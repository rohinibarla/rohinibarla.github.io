Keep doing things that you care for. Every moment is unique. It's the only chance to experience, act, express, involve. Every person is unique. Speech is a valuable thing for me, speak words that multiply joy. Speak with emotion, speak with involvement. Speak the minimum possible. Make children experience nature. Have things going. Moving running needed. Keep the body agile. Keep the mind agile. Be agile. Be alive. Involve in everything you do. Prepone things. Bring out the best in you.
