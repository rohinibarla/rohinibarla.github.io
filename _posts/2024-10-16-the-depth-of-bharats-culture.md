Answering a question on the depth and magnitude of Indian culture, Sadhguru explains that for anyone to preserve and celebrate their heritage, first they must have a deep sense of pride in it. Citing examples of the tremendous contribution of Indian culture across the world, some of which date back to 4000 years ago, Sadhguru explains that certain fundamentals need to be re-examined, including the way history is taught in the country.

Useful for students to understand.


### The Essence of Indian Culture
Sadhguru looks at how unlike most cultures on the planet, which were designed for survival, Indian culture was designed consciously for the inner wellbeing of a human being.

### Preserving Indian Culture
While cultural evolution can be a natural process, when culture is under attack from commercial forces, Sadhguru explains, one needs a strategy to save it. Indian culture was engineered to lead people to the spiritual process, and for its preservation, Sadhguru says, while moral policing is not required, education is a must.

### What Keeps Indian Culture Alive?
Fashion designer Tarun Tahiliani asks Sadhguru why Indians seem to prefer Western culture and attitudes to India's own intrinsic values and culture. Sadhguru looks at the fundamental ethos and thread that binds Indian culture together, and explain how it is only the spiritual process that has kept Indian culture alive, despite centuries of persecution during the British Raj.
