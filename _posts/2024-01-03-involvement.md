Notes.

Involvement in every little thing you do.  
Identifying with something you are not is the root cause of suffering.  
When you involve absolutely, in a way you dissolve.  
From the past experience, it's clear that the moments of involvement are the joyful moments.  
Popularly in software development people refer to as when you are in a flow things happen fast.  
Restfulness comes with absolute involvement.
