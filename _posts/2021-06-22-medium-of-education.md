After seeing the news, it was not new but, old one only...
How Machaly's influence is still growing so strong...

Why did I join my child in English medium, without even thinking about it?
How many private schools are there with Telugu medium?
National Education Policy suggests to teach in Mother toungue for the first 4 years. What will happen?

Why not start schools in every state containing these 6 langauges to start with with medium of instruction in their mother tongue.

What will we teach?
mother-tougue, Samskrutham, Observational drawing without instructions, creating and constructing things with mud, bricks and other materials.

No writing for first 3 years. Allow them to create knowledge in groups. Elders job is to create a journal of the knowledge created by each child and groups.

Just pencils and paper and no ERASERS.

Feedbacks like the butterfly drawing.

Singing Slokhas. Isha Yoga for children.

Allow them to be part of elder's work.

Make them explore nature. Water, wind, plants, farming, animals.

Games for children to tell who have how many toys. Children exchange.

Explain about what they saw yesterday.

Voice modulation techniques.

Singing...
Dancing...

Talk in what ever languages you want.

Do you want to fit them in the normal schools later?
