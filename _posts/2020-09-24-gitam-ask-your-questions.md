Today, as part of the induction program to first-year CSE students of GITAM. We (me and Dr. Kranthi Sir) will have 30 mins discussion to show the big picture of computer science.

[Here you can post questions.](https://collabqa.com/6417213fa69b2225) We will answer the questions, which are not covered in the discussion as different blog posts to nurture engineering students' curiosity.
