The impact of creating this statue...  
Young people of Bhārat cannot understand, since they are not exposed to the dubios standards of the world.

To put it simply, our minds are colonised. Westerners still see as if they have taught us everything.   

This one is a tight slap for western people who try to teach equality or humanity to people of Bharat.  What are they doing 1000 years ago?  

Everyone needs to read the story of శ్రీ రామానుజాచార్య. How he has delt with the situations around him. Why are we celebrating him even after 1000 years.  

Pawan Kalyan put it in simple words. What శ్రీ రామానుజాచార్య represents?
