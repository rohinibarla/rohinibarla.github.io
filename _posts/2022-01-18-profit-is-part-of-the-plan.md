Profit is not the purpose.  
Profit is part of the plan.  
You need profit to fulfill the purpose.  
Without profit, you cannot keep any situation going.  
  
Investments we make money, time, energies, above all our life that we invest.  
There has to be a return.  
If there is no return, no activity is sustainable.  
  
Return need not be money count.  
Growth, reach, how many people you touched.  
your service or product transforms life on the planet.  
  
Establish a burning purpose in your heart, which you never let it cool.  
Day and night it must be burning.

Anywhere in the world,  
the greatest thing to accomplish anything is   
the smallest details are taken care of by somebody.  
otherwise, the big things won't happen.
