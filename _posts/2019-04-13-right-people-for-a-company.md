When speaking to my friend about the hiring and training program, I have done. I was saying 8 people from the batch are committed. In that context, he says...
If a person has some basics and is committed, he is a good fit for the company in the long run.
A person working with commitment, there is no limit to his growth.

When I reflect, that is what is lacking in me. When I reflect back on my last year's work, this is one thing that is missing.

This year needs to show commitment in action.

Just commit to what you can do. Once committed, there is no changing of minds, it has to be done.
