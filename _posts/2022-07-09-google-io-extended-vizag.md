Google I/O Extended Vizag

Went to the event to meet people. Met people whom I know earlier like Shanmuk, Alok, Ravi Shankar, Usha Ramani and one student.

The presentations made in the event are as expected.

One elderly professor gave presentation. Without tools you are poor man. His name is Professor. If you are not active you will perish is what he says @75.
His website url is sites.google.com/....

Interacting with my student, came to know how eager they are to learn. He has started many courses, but did not complete. It's best to start with something to create and create it using the tools and languages. This will help in understanding and being aware of the practical use of the tools and languages.

Cyber security is one interesting area for students, where to start, what to do... is not well known till now.

One student from ECE of GVP is interested in Battery technology optimization using ML. So thought these are some of the startups that are working in his field of interest.

Shanmuk says, their is gold in the internet, why will students come to your online course on C programming. My goal is to make the students into gold miners. By bridging the gap. Between his current ability and future ability to use the best resources in the internet. 

Alok has been running summer internship program for students of Annamayya university in AU. Some of them came to the event. Actually the event took place in the seminar hall, which they have been using for the summer internship. In that sense, event took place in their place of work.

Ravi sir gave some presentation on innovation. There was music by children at the end of the event. The violen was soothing to the ears.

Met a person related to Atal Tinkering labs. Thought of experimenting with the bharat programming languages for students to learn.

Met Jagadeswar Rao, recent graduate who works in Data Science field. He is ambitious, but has been fighting with the system.

Follow up is to arrange an event to learn git and github in GVP online.

It was well arranged. The networking session was timely.

There is a lot that can be done in Vizag. There is a cost. Are we willing to pay the price is the only question. Or is it a passing thought.
