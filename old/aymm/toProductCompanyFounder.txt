Dear <Product-Company-Founder>,

As you know it's very hard to find good product engineers in software domain.

In short we want to solve this problem, by putting all our efforts at the right time.

In detail, the current model of learning is oriented towards 'how to pass the interview with least effort just few months before the interview'. The interview is just a point of reference for asserting the capability of developing a software. 

We want to make them capable in programming and developing software starting in the 1st year of B.Tech itself. We strongly beleive that if the necessary fundamentals of programming is taught to the students, in the first year itself. He will be a great software engineer by the end of B.Tech.

I have worked in Software product companies for 12 years. I have produced few software developers, who can learn any new technology that is going to come in the future. I know what are the needed capabilities for a person to become a good software developer. Some of them are listed bellow.
