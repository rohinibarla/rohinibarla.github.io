Goals:
- Write a basic download manager.
- Write a basic bit torrent App.

// you can implement in any language other than C-language

<h3>#1: Write a basic download manager</h3>
Given one of the sample URL's as input. The download manager should
- Use HEAD command of HTTP to get the meta-data (response-header) of the remote file
- Get the length of the file using value of "Content-Length" key in response-header
- start 4 threads and 
- simultaniously download the file as 4 parts and
- join the parts and 
- save in a file



The HTTP HEAD method asks for a response identical to that of a GET request, but without the
response body. This is useful for retrieving meta-information written in response
headers, without having to transport the entire content.

From the response headers, value of the "Content-Length" key will give you the length of
the remote file in bytes.

<h3>#2: Write a basic bit torrent Application</h3>
<b>Central Server must support APIs to:</b>
- register as peer
- get list of peers


<b>Bit torrent has both client and server components executing in the same process:</b>
// When executing bit torrent, the central server IP address is given as argument

server component must support APIs like
- get list of available parts // each part is fixed size of 64KB
- get N'th part of the file

client component must perform the following tasks
- register with the central server
- get the list of peers
- connect to each peer in a seperate thread
    - get the list of parts available with peer
    - download each part if not available
- Once all the part are available, "Download completed" message is printed


Both the server component and client component share 
- the meta-data regarding details of the parts that are available and 
- partial or full content of the file.


To test 
- start the central server on a machine (say M1).
- start 2 bit torrents on 2 machines 
(with IP address of M1, -have [ firsthalf | secondhalf ], -filepath "filepath")
These 2 machines, one will have the first part, the second one will have the second
part of the file. // the way you acheive this is by providing a file path (file that
is being replicated) and special parameter to specify which part is available
(e.g: -have firsthalf; -have secondhalf)
- Start bit torrent on 2 more machines (with IP address of M1 as input)
- After some time all the 4 machines must have the complete file.
