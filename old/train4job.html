Hi,

<br>
I love to teach programming from basics and impart confidence in youth.  
I am Rohini Barla. I was born in Visakhapatnam. Did my BTech in CSE @GITAM college. Did my MTech @IIT Kanpur. Kanpur has imparted unwavering confidence in me. Worked in Microsoft for 7 years. Moved to a startup, where I developed iOS SDK for their mobile fabric platform. I have trained ~100 people to get a job as fresher (as iOS Developer), when they were not freshers. Today they all are well settled and each one is earning  around 6 Lacks package.  I exactly know the capabilities needed to start career in software industry.

I am planning to train people for 6 months.
    - who has interest to develop Apps in iOS.  or
    - who want to start there career iOS developer. or
    - who want to change their career to iOS development.

Duration is 6 months.


Prerequisites:
- A machine with latest OS X installed ( Mac or Windows machine)
- Passion to learn and patience to put the effort.
- any degree pass or fail.

<b>My goal is simple, to make you capable of developing iOS Apps. We will achieve this by making you develop and upload 2 Apps to App Store, in the course.</b> You can check the course details <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/rohinikumarbarla">here</a>.
If you want to become an iOS developer or If you have any questions, or there's anything I can do to make you successful, please get in touch.
