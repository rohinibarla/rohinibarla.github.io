Planning for acheiving the above goals
--------------------------------------

Activities & Concepts & Principles
- Algorithms & six principles
- Writing in 5 programming languages
	- language: input output, arrays, single function.
	- coding style
- CodeHS puzzles for 
	- Functions
	- Top down design
	- Indentation
- Fundamentals of computing
- Parrots training, take your learning into your hands
- Command line interface using codenvy.io or VM
- Git and Github
- Write 3 programs from each language and commit to github using codenvy.io
- Blogging using Evernote & Postach.io & Grammerly
- Using your brains & learn how to learn
- Protyping user interface
- Brain Storming method and PMI tool
- Touch Typing
- Fundamental Of Computing slides
- Build 2 Applications


Activities with details
-----------------------

Algorithms and Principles
- Start in new left page, dry run on right page.
- Do dry-run for every algorithm that you write.
- Write down what is wrong in each incorrect algorithm.

Principles with less number of words:
End User Experience, Readability, Correctness, Multiple Solutions, Nested loops, No Duplicate code, Optimization, Collections.

Should we tell the principle and make them write, or just orally say them?
Which is better?



Implement algorithms in different languages
- Keep a notes of all the material that you have reffered, e.g. the websites or blog post that you have read.
- Keep saving the compiler error messages that you get in the process. Which are important to learn the vocabulary of compilers. This will help in working in new languages quickly.
- Review first 3 programs. Next 10 programs, and the remaining.

Writing regularly
- Create account in Evernote and move your notes in it.
- Create blog using postach.io, And Connect to one notebook in Evernote.
- Keep writing one blog post daily.
- Use grammerly to fix mistakes in your blog post.
- Note: This must be started after they complete implementation in 2 langauges.


Single guideline for work and life
----------------------------------
If you do everything like 
it is the last and only thing
you are going to do in your life, 
if you do everything as if 
your very life depends on it, 
you don’t have to do 
anything in particular.



Learning will simply happen because all that it needs is a conducive atmosphere. 


Note:
At any point of time, there must be only 1 unknown.
So a list of all the unknows will give insight into what we are try to make the student think and get comfortable with.
